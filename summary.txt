Summary

flappy bird game is actually made using deep reinforcement machine learning.

This game is fully automated such that you just need a browser and visit the website to actually watch the output.

The backbone is made with neuroevolution javascript library and it is reponsible for creating neural networks and generations. 

The algorithm calculates the distance between pipes and birds so as to escape in between pipes and then selecting best performing models among 50 birds in the next generations. 

As generations goes on the birds actually train themselves to escape all orientation of pipes. 

The entire game is designed in pure vanilla javascript and html canvas. It is simple and easy to run even for novice. Also buttons are made to monitor the flow of game with speed change.

In short, a simple and lean machine learning application via this game flappy bird.
